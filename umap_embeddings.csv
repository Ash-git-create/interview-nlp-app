7.4796214,4.965177,7," I don't know, I can't really think of anything.  I just been playing a little golf and producing a baby and that is all, really.  Just stay home."
7.663672,4.863393,7," No, and don't tell me what is going on. I don't and don't tell me what is going on.  Please."
6.218374,5.302598,2,"  Yeah, I think I'm always pretty good no matter if we have fans or not.  I always talk about staying in my bubble, and that term has really got a different meaning this year."
6.6722856,4.805119,4,"I was going to say, Marcus over here was in the finals of the MVP of the American League, and here you are sitting here first Team. Does this validate the season you put together?"
8.219863,4.003219,2," Obviously today was more of a grind than last Thursday.  But still, still saw some good scores, obviously not as many as we saw last week."
5.4432783,4.234586,2,"Yeah, I think she was tired in the third set and she -- when she start -- when I start to play, you know, longer points she was really tired."
6.679471,6.0220428,2,"Yeah, Zack's preparation is probably the best in the game. There's a couple of guys here, too, as well, with Max and Stras and An??Ãªbal, those guys as well."
6.064596,2.6066506,2," I managed to hit some of my shots close, and the ones that I didn't I managed to save par."
6.7358747,2.949061,3,"  Yeah, he's just battling through the heel.  He was struggling to move a little bit but toughed it out, and we'll see how he feels tomorrow."
7.0717883,3.640201,3, It is like during the Wimbledon -- before the main game she was practicing and she injured at the Wimbledon.
7.3263984,6.405919,1,"Yeah, I mean, having them go out there and be aggressive, a lot of the credit goes to the scout defense.  Day-in and day-out they gave us a great look."
7.820422,6.6996655,2, I can't say that I turned it up because he doublefaulted three times.  I wish I could take credit for turning it up.
8.533572,3.6601472,2,"  It's unusual.  It's rare that you would dominate the 500 the way we did, support a single driver to win the drivers championship, then bring home the manufacturers trophy."
6.034313,4.931171,2,"I feel great. We've had good speed. I look at Vegas, if we didn't get the damage, get trapped down a lap there for a minute, we were really good there, capable of winning."
7.940009,6.503363,2," It's just about fairest match I play. Today I was expected to do win, I came through, I'm expected to win tomorrow and I'll go out and do what I do and hopefully things work out."
6.5352077,7.190629,6, We just said that we are going to make a couple of tournaments before the Open and the Open.  We didn't talk afterwards.
7.2727194,4.279588,6,"You obviously love your chances, you've won it twice before, what is it about that makes this event so special?"
6.5109806,2.610226,5,It's not a bad four-year run. It almost feels like it got started against us a few years ago at our place. And they've had their foot on the gas pedal ever since.
7.095362,6.6028976,5,"  I had so much champagne, I don't even remember what I said to my dad.  Probably I love him.  He's proud of me and I told him this is why we work, this is why we grind.  He congratulated me."
6.0806437,2.3584828,2,"  I hit pretty good tee shot and I have like 195 and it's like downwind, so I hit 6-iron and I have 20 feet and make the putt."
6.995408,6.2507625,2,"  I don't think Andre lacked anything.  I think Andre has all of the tools to be a great player, and he is a great player."
9.087023,6.138695,5,Absolutely. We're all about winning it all. That's what we're all about. That's what fan base is all about. I think we're going to field the Team that gives us the best opportunity to do that.
7.7059197,5.0314975,7," Last year I was here watching a little bit, yeah.  The year before, I am not sure, I might have been here too watching it.  I don't know."
8.825711,5.390748,2," Yeah, two weeks have been just great. No one expect me to go to the quarterfinal, it has been great two weeks.  I am happy that I won. After all, I am very satisfied."
7.5738173,5.6950707,2," You know, played very well the.  He gave me the opportunities; I took them.  That is why I played well."
9.119921,5.299315,5,"First of all, congratulations to Stanford. They played a great match tonight. And for our group, obviously disappointing for this season to come to an end after so many adventures that we went on together."
4.805223,5.1299853,5,"  No.  This Team does not get nervous.  We are a very poised, confident group.  We are prepared to go out and play each and every game, and this week is no different."
5.466851,6.898895,2,"I was trying to put away the hitter. For me something very big because that hitter is very big right now, he's on fire. And it's taking something special for me. And it was very good."
6.8078103,4.929914,2,"I mean, I think certainly early in the season that was a major factor. As the season has progressed, it's become less and less of a factor, but it's because we've had to adjust how we do business."
6.8817854,6.7439756,7,"We've been talking a lot. Talk a little bit about baseball, talk about his workouts, and other stuff. He's in a good place."
5.4369855,6.473091,7,"  Yeah, absolutely.  It's gorgeous out here.  Really made it super fun having so many people watch, even though it wasn't official spectators."
8.601282,6.1154256,1,"I'm not thinking.  That's something that me and Matt have connected on before.  Incredible look by Matt, and I just had to do the easiest part and put it in the back of the net."
5.911871,4.139216,2," Why, because they are all so good and they have done so many good things in golf.  They have won so many tournaments, their golf game is just close to perfection, so of course I am intimidated."
5.808935,4.84136,2," Yeah, yeah, it's much better with my technique.  It's much better and now on I knew on hardcourt I couldn't play good.  I could play good, but now, I'm sure."
7.9105844,6.2709446,2,"I think it made a difference. We ran second, led some laps, ran second all day. We were just a little bit off on speed from the 18 I felt like."
4.8555098,6.361349,2,"Yeah, it just depends on what type of hitter you are. Some people stick to your approach. Some people try to play along a little bit and kind of get a step ahead of him."
6.389663,3.4975677,5,  I felt like that a little bit.  I notice that Ally would always make it on top of me so I thought I was good motivation for her.
7.559842,3.9581382,2,"  Oh, my God.  (Laughs) I'm done.  It was a struggle today, especially off the tee.  I think I was spending more time with the crowd than I was inside the ropes today.  So being very fan friendly today."
6.7726207,2.7359035,3,"This is something that, like I said, he came in yesterday and felt it a little bit and had these little spasms. Today he woke up and it was a lot worse."
8.533969,6.361902,4,"Well, I wouldn't expect the worst strikeout Team to be in the World Series, you know what I'm saying? So I expect them to be good and they are really good."
6.990062,4.179071,2, You've had an incredible season this year.  What do you put it down to?  You've been winning almost every other week.
7.462926,6.1584644,4,"First of all, I'll certainly give Salisbury the credit they deserve.  I thought they played a very good game today, very disciplined on offense, and their defense played tight all day.  I give them a lot of credit."
7.575231,4.150711,7," Oh, absolutely.  What can I tell you? Three days, I have been all day in the place here trying to play some tennis.  Finally I could go out yesterday for a couple of hours to get something."
7.14736,4.346571,7,"  The snarl?  I kind of just did it.  I've never really made that face before, like ever in my really entire life.  Kind of just happened in the midst of things, in the moment."
7.640332,3.4722598,2," I don't know.  I haven't played on stadium.  But compared to the other courts, it is slower, yeah.  It is a little bit difficult for a serve and volley player to play well there."
6.03585,5.9828367,5,"I echo that. When you have a place that you're proud of that you can go and say, This is such a beautiful field, let's all meet there, let's get together, the camaraderie, it's just amazing."
9.631178,4.70516,7,"  I'm definitely going to take some time off again.  I took a couple days off before this event, spend it with family.  I'm turning 23 on Wednesday and I don't know what I'm going to do yet."
6.339961,6.12644,5,"I'll second that.  They are tremendous players but even better people off the field.  I mean, just their leadership and their charisma is very easy to follow."
6.531042,4.9603443,6," Oh.  He is going to be tough.  I mean, he is very good player.  He is the top player.  So it is going to be tough."
6.614324,4.598014,6," I am not really looking that far ahead, playing Michael.  Right now I'm concerned about playing Enqvist and I will worry about it when the time comes."
5.8128085,5.3052673,2,"Well, blocking against Jazz Sweet is pretty frustrating, I'm not going to lie but I think we did a pretty good job of staying patient. They were going to get there but we weren't going to get too frustrated."
6.2428617,3.5799377,5,"All of them. I feel great, ready to go. This is exactly what I needed to get through here and get a little momentum built up. So feel good about all of them. "
9.114888,6.485426,5,"  Well, I guess to me, it just means that I played on some very good Teams, that's all.  Fortunate to be on the Teams that have made it this far."
7.550616,5.414044,7,"Obviously, there's measures in this contract that allow for the club to extend the payouts a few extra years in the contract that allows the immediacy of their payroll in the current year is where it has more flexibility."
9.418683,6.198552,1,"Of course. That's always going to help. And, again, like I said before, every Team here is looking for starters because you can never have enough. That's just a fact."
7.9833384,3.7194326,4,"I truly believe -- we had opportunities today. We've been doing really well, driving in runs with men in scoring position; it just didn't happen today. So we'll come back tomorrow."
6.8862453,5.2180476,7, To early to get in any kind of sense for me.  I don't think I have that much of a feel for the tournament yet.
6.244529,6.433547,1,"No, we're not practicing that, but I have some knowledge about that. So we share the knowledge with the girls, and we take the decisions -- I talk to keeper and bowler and one senior player. That's it."
8.977785,4.7301893,6, I would say so.  Obviously depends on what we get tomorrow.  But I think these are the conditions you expect when you come over here.
8.277981,4.1054378,2," Well, the 15 majors, but obviously that would be something very, very special.  I think so, yeah.  But hopefully before I get to 15, I'm up at 90."
8.159715,5.397793,7,"Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not the hiring authority, so I don't know, but I think it's important that we have really strong women in positions of leadership in our sport."
7.0934296,2.3881288,2, I dived because I had to get the point and there was a little bit of luck and I got it.
9.493289,4.7942624,3,"I'm actually looking at him right now, he just walked in my office. We haven't talked yet. I'm going to find out his status. He's going to talk to you in a few minutes."
8.261348,4.3158526,2," Yeah, I would definitely say so.  The approaches are also difficult to play in this kind of windy conditions, but still, I think it gives her more problems to pass me than for me coming in.  That is for sure."
8.287612,5.925527,2,  You don't get a chance to know each other too well.  The thing I know about him is he is a great leader for his football Team and he is a great player.
7.3671756,2.928082,2,"There was a lot of things that could happen with lap cars, him guessing wrong, me being able to run the bottom or run the top or get a good run or something along those lines. It never materialized. "
7.085118,2.4952526,2,"Marisnick? Jake is an impact defender, he's got some base running skills that we can utilize hitting in front of the pitcher. He's got a little bit of history with Corbin, having done pretty well with him."
8.488536,2.9725819,7,"  It was fun.  It's nice having my brother on the bag, but it's cool.  This is the first time dad has caddied for me since I've been on tour."
5.2416515,5.303607,3," Obviously, it didn't.  Usually I play pretty well when I have an injury, but normally I don't make it a habit."
8.652894,4.4712324,5,I think we obviously have to respond from last night.  It's always about what's in front of you.  Whatever is behind is in the past.  You have no control over it.
5.269714,2.4829433,1,"  Yeah, you know, we realized what they were doing defensive-wise, so we had a much better offensive output in this game, move the ball, move the ball, move the ball, and skew their defense."
6.9213257,4.8616357,7,"Yeah, to be honest, we haven't talked all about it. I know he had a great run. I think we all respect his career beyond just that. Yeah, just trying to get better."
7.005869,2.462082,2,"No, for me, he just got -- he starts the game, he gets a little quick. But then he settled down for a little bit and then Chirinos hit a good change-up."
7.19856,4.55069,2,  Probably on 16.  That was the longest putt that I holed today.  It was kind of across the green down there by the water.
5.3156605,5.669006,5," No.  Each one wants to do the best she can.  But we don't think ""I want to be better than my sister.""  Each one wants to do the best she can, but for herself."
7.8290234,6.5332885,5," Absolutely.  I'd like to see Michelle, although I didn't want her to win on Sunday because I wanted to win, but as it turned out neither of us won; obviously Karrie won."
8.498656,6.792692,4,Michigan State was a physical Team.  They dominated us in all three aspects of the game.  I thought they were a really well coached Team and physical throughout all four quarts.
6.4967246,3.826982,6,"Well, we feel like we're -- two years ago now this next year we feel like coming into this next season that's going to be the goal. It should be when you have won back-to-back 97-game seasons."
8.883273,5.698542,5,"I agree with everything they said. I couldn't have asked for a better senior year, and I'm just so thankful for everyone (tearing) Texas A&M volleyball has a really bright future and I'm excited to watch."
7.419317,6.9718685,2,"Yeah, absolutely, I got a couple to fix up about my mechanic, and I want to work this offseason about that."
5.3168583,4.2139063,7," Not many people would, but if someone starts to mention, hey, this and that the other, I say listen I could careless."
8.67566,5.871351,2,"Yeah, that line's been great for us whenever they're together.  Robby came in, brought some speed, some legs.  Looked pretty good."
6.6676664,4.266887,2, Not particularly.  I think surface probably suits him a little more than it suits me.  Probably more comfortable on this than he is on grass.
8.593143,4.3000474,5,"Obviously very proud to have followed Fernando Valenzuela, obviously something historic, and something that I'm obviously very happy about, very happy to have followed him and to have done what I've done today."
7.493869,5.2347383,5,I don't know about it is remarkable.  I think it is a testament of what people can endure or persevere.
5.5808315,3.888605,2,"Well, you're right, he was good in the No. 1 spot.  He was playing well, he likes to play fast, he was comfortable playing in the No. 1 spot.  Get out there and go, you know."
7.69653,2.7128284,5,"Enjoy it. Honestly, it's stuff you gotta go through. I got a lot of advice from friends of mine. Kevin Cash, he's one of them. Something you gotta go through."
7.5867844,6.1504617,5,"  Well, I don't know if that's true or what it is.  I think preparation and opportunity, those two things combine, good things happen."
6.3355403,3.7011328,7,"  Definitely feel a certain level of disconnection.  When you're here, you very much feel like you're in a bubble and kind of secluded and separated from the outside world."
5.9805565,6.4999576,2, Is this the best win that you have ever had against a big player or have you beaten another top player?
6.7219276,5.286308,7,"  I tell you tomorrow.  It is nothing knew to me.  I mean, I have been playing singles, doubles, mixed doubles at the tournaments, so it is no different than any other tournament."
7.6157484,3.189774,2," I will ask Tiger the same question after being the lead now at 6-under.  Some thoughts on your round today, and if you could go through your round card, if you don't mind."
7.178828,4.094027,2,"  You know, just being aggressive.  Taking the same shots that I took last game, and just having confidence in that.  My Teammates have confidence in me to score the ball."
7.539532,3.4646368,2," There was a serve.  It is difficult from the other side to judge a serve, but I felt it was out."
7.775982,6.565776,7,"And one more thing to add, the humidors don't really address the issue of drag. The humidors will affect the coefficient of restitution, but sort of the topic of drag isn't likely to be impacted by that."
5.206661,5.4099946,2,"  I think what everybody sees in them, they are very athletic.  They don't give up a lot of big plays and they make good plays."
5.663363,5.7998815,7, I am just going to let the Europeans do it because we are on deadline and if we want to go back to English we can.
8.289739,5.323506,2,"No, I don't think so.  He's a good defender, and I mean, I only one scored goal, so he did his job, I guess, and he played his position well."
8.2015,2.9358685,8,"It was pretty clear??Ãª<U+0080><U+0091>cut. The 21 hung a left, drove those guys down below the line. We called that twice on the 22 car during the race, so nothing different there."
8.357885,5.0489187,5,"Well, it's obviously a different experience.  Something that I'll definitely remember.  Something  that I'll look back on with fond memories."
9.364542,3.8650444,5,"Melanie, thank you so much. I want to echo as well your dad, truly amazing and inspiring, Mike. Definitely want to thank him for all of his efforts, and obviously your whole family. So thank you."
8.439507,6.001581,2,"Again, an incredible look by Matt Moore.  He did the grit, and I just saw a shooting lane and I took it.  But Matt Moore did an incredible job, eyes up, and to see the player he's become is incredible."
6.9180026,5.8877225,4,"Obviously we played a lot of world-class Teams in this tournament. But this performance would probably be one to remember by the players themselves, giving them motivation, and also for the fans back home as well."
5.5217676,2.3226817,2,"They positioned themselves pretty well. But we hit some balls hard. Trea hit a couple balls hard today, actually three balls hard. We've just got to keep battling."
5.794384,4.991777,4,"  It feels pretty good.  It is always good to win a Grand Slam title even in mixed.  I think very special and you only have so many chances to win them, they are good to take."
7.5169363,5.015604,7,My mom is someone that I talk to a lot and obviously she helped me out this morning. We had coffee. Just gave me some words of encouragement.
7.3190627,2.5020306,2,He's been vital to our run up to this point.  There's no question about that.  We are not here without him playing at such a high level.
7.8923545,7.131656,1,"Good afternoon, everyone. I have a couple of topics that I would like to cover and then obviously I will take questions, some of which I may answer."
8.702018,4.7388244,7,I am just very happy to be there.  It is just -- it is no time to be surprised or not to be surprised.
6.9470124,3.2782934,6," He's going to come out swinging, he's got a really nice backhand and he's been playing well all week, and I hope I can put the pressure on him and serve like I did today and we'll see what happens."
6.63292,3.6824744,2,I will still working on the same thing because like the first two hole I keep thinking about the outcome and I don't have good commitment at all.
4.6940656,4.401612,2,"  I thought to myself, I said, I tried to get a pitch to hit and he made a good pitch.  That was a fastball and I handled it."
6.2435155,3.3019943,4,"  It was a good settler.  I felt like I started fine, a little bit more steady than yesterday, so to roll that birdie in was good to gain some momentum for the rest of the day."
9.528299,4.8398795,5,"  I'm doing the same thing.  I'm gassing him up.  I feel like I'm putting that battery in his back.  There's a lot of times I tell him, ""Don't pass."""
6.1939945,6.3887525,5,"I think that's an Individual thing. Players have to pick themselves up. Management or anyone can go out and give advice, but at the end of the day, it's up to the player to go out there and execute."
7.570695,4.9151053,7,"Let me just add to that, that when Lloyd says we have no idea, you could interpret that to mean that nobody in this world has any idea because, if Lloyd doesn't know, then nobody knows. (Laughter.)"
7.9065223,4.7142096,5,"Obviously you can always shut the short.  So maybe give them something different.  Coach Conry was like  Nope, we're sticking to who we are and what we're all about."
6.9945564,3.0746772,4," When I am out there, it feels like it would be nice to know that I am a serving a little bit better and not miss easy shots at breakpoints, or game points or whatever."
6.319539,5.3643284,4," When you win a few matches, I beat good players, then you get more confidence and then you know that you can beat good players.  So that has happened a lot."
6.603175,6.9597087,8,"It's not what I want to be here talking about. And hopefully when AJ gets in here, he'll get back to talking about Game 3 and this series."
7.9746237,5.0833664,8,"To be honest with you, that probably helped distract me through the majority of the week. Just being able to talk about something else, not being so caught up in a points situation."
8.541303,4.3543653,4,"Yeah, it's been a long year, up and down.  All worth it in the end.  Obviously a little bonus scoring that goal last night, too."
6.410428,2.9721599,2," Yeah, not really-- and after they broke us, she got very confident.  She started to psych up and going for the shots."
5.253345,2.6846297,3,He felt something when he went to block that ball in his hip flexor. We don't know the severity of it yet. We'll know more tomorrow. But it is his right hip flexor.
8.731348,6.9525557,7,"ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (Through Leo Astacio)   I have given thought to everyone on their Team.  Luis Gonzalez, he's a member of that Team and I have thought about all of them."
7.1028357,4.6481137,4,"  Yeah, well, I knew that today playing in the morning, especially early, was going to be much more difficult than yesterday, as was shown by the scores yesterday morning."
6.55476,5.4059505,6," First, to rest, then I will see what other tournaments I will be playing and if it is Australia or not."
6.381611,5.915219,1,"  Yeah, obviously that opportunity helps, but I'm just getting out there and seizing the opportunity and knowing that I need to make plays in order for us to be successful."
6.1926985,7.2049537,1,"  You know, that's a great question.  I think the biggest thing is for me just studying the game, realizing what my strengths are and what Teams are trying to take away from my game."
6.212155,6.2390738,7,"He was a very smart player, and now he can share the knowledge he has with the players that he's going to manage. Carlos was always well respected, well received, and I know he will be there, as well."
5.9992676,3.9853816,8,"  I've never managed to find a comfort zone on this golf course.  It amazes me, but I think that's a tribute to how great of a design it is."
9.349415,5.106006,4,"Congratulations to Wesleyan, and Coach Raba a tremendous game.  It was a battle for 60 minutes.  They got the best of us today, but we battled till the end, and I'm very proud of the Seagulls."
6.159299,4.2876143,7," The Other Side of Midnight, and Memory -- Memories, something like that.  Two books of Sidney Sheldon.  So I finish them up.  So I don't have any  more to read.  I have to buy new ones."
8.145666,5.841214,7,"Hi, everybody. I'm Jon Sciambi, and it is my pleasure to welcome you all to this year's announcement of the 8th annual Winter Meetings Charity Auction. So thanks for being here. Appreciate it."
6.677062,6.303658,3,"Andy is fully recovered and has started maybe some light hitting. He's on a regular schedule. He'll be without any sort of setback in any area, he'll be 100 percent full go in Spring Training."
5.8156567,6.4139066,7,A lot of different and for the last days I played with some juniors because there is no more big players.
7.7189555,5.7709394,4,"Yeah, I agree with what both of them said. I think this is a really great way for us to go out, and to go out with this group of people who happen to be some of our best friends."
5.730664,4.9702444,2," I cannot think about that right now. Actually, my dream was to play one more good Grand Slam and retire and maybe it is coming true."
8.425806,4.837759,1,"It was really something that's been in the works for a little bit. I've sort of changed around my strategy going into, I guess, T20 cricket."
5.962433,3.8946335,4,I feel great right now.  What a beautiful day to play golf.  Braved the last two holes to kind of get myself back in the game.
5.0443892,6.2759795,1,I try not to watch my competitors anyway.  I try not to watch what they do all that much anyway.
5.3542256,4.6742754,7,"Probably so.  Actually he makes all sizes.  I know that my waist is a 30, but in his clothes I'm a 32, so it makes me feel a little bigger."
5.688715,6.42989,7,"The field crew at University of Arizona, they were my best buds. Johnny O., he was the director, he still is today. And the mound was absolutely gorgeous, the grass, there wasn't one flaw. So definitely University of Arizona."
8.921417,5.5560913,4,"First, just congratulations to Minnesota on a great season. They're a great Team. We saw them early and they definitely presented some unique challenges."
8.437913,3.9205713,6,Not really. We were just worrying about today. We knew that going in I guess there wasn't any reserve day. Hopefully the forecast changes. I've seen that happen before. And hopefully we get two really good semifinals in.
5.880765,5.9981446,4,You're obviously one of the leading players on the LET at the moment.  Does that put extra pressure on you coming in this week against players from America?
9.423607,4.5529885,1,"Yeah, it's definitely uncharted territory. And I'm just trying to continue to do what I've tried to do all year, is just take it one day at a time and just listen to the body."
6.0591216,6.3586607,8,"Yeah, because that's not coming from the players on the field. The players on the field, it's their job to guard against the players on the field. You can't guard against technology and players off the field."
7.7247667,5.3192534,2,"Gee, this is a Lisa Raymond -- Natasha Zvereva press conference. I don't know. Frankly, I don't know. I don't think anything lacking. She is playing good."
7.2603836,3.4309754,3,I had injured it the Friday just before the Monday at San Diego the tournament practicing.  I would probably say it affects me most definitely running.  On my serve and my backhand.
5.6086144,3.4814315,7,"Well, right now, based on what the organization make the move, we hired -- they hired him, before I got here, to be the closer. So that's something that we have to talk about."
5.4435635,4.934061,8,"Yeah, I appreciate the question. I think a lot -- people have spoken on this. I've spoken on this, I addressed it right away. Jeff just spoke."
6.9416776,2.668003,5,"The key for them is clearly Plummer. If she's good, then that creates space for everyone else. Everyone else can take a little breath. If they have to lean on everyone else, it gets a little bit different."
8.3164625,6.4048443,7,"We're excited to have with us a number of players who were named to the first and second Teams. Join me in welcoming the All-MLB second Team, designated hitter of the Houston Astros, Yordan Alvarez is with us."
8.356822,5.13697,7,"I think I will not miss cricket -- I mean, I'll be involved because I can't stay away from this. And somehow I'll be involved with cricket."
7.103964,6.5552497,1,"You know, I can't say we practice it a ton.  We talk about power play, that sort of thing.  Then defending also I think is something we cover and talk about."
6.1701922,4.2370644,4,"  I think I definitely left  -- I did yesterday, as well.  You know, one of my  -- one of my things about this golf course is that I just don't read those greens well."
8.797847,5.0537086,2,"  Yeah, so coming from KPMG I was extremely happy with my long game from tee to green, but the putts were not really dropping that week."
6.5574374,2.6052306,4,"  Is that aggressive?  (Laughs.) No, I think I played pretty well.  I'm getting it in the fairway, and then I really hit some good iron shots today."
8.019128,3.885449,5,Very happy with the home run. Obviously today all my Teammates were saying today is your day. Today is your day. And it happened so obviously very happy about it.
5.5512824,4.366588,2," I think I was very tired -- I was tired because I have been all the week with diarrhea, because the food here is not very good for me.  I was very tired, the whole match."
6.5825934,4.6097436,4," Yeah, a big surprise.  I was really surprised about; especially Jennifer yesterday.  I knew she had a tough match yesterday.  It wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't think she was going to lose."
6.135542,6.7482233,7," When the rankings were first released, she was ranked third.  I think any time you have a prominent player, there's always discussion.  Anyone who you ask, whether there's resistance or discussion, that's up for debate."
8.955171,6.6890426,4,"I think it affected our Team.  You know, I think collectively a lot of things affected our Team.  I do think that affected our Team."
6.088549,2.7196553,1,We started on the back nine and I started off hitting a 5-iron in there probably 18 feet from the hole and knocked it in for birdie.
6.382802,2.2109773,2," He was serving for the match at 5-1.  He was Love-all; he had hit a smash wide, real wide, and it was- -"
7.9779415,7.222182,1," You know, that's a hard question to answer simply because you haven't replaced it with another event.  The answer would probably be yes, I would have played, and I would have taken the  same approach."
6.9781585,4.567208,4,"It was tough for him, first game back.  That's a big game.  Obviously they didn't get a whole lot of time up there, so it's hard to evaluate it that much."
6.594172,6.569827,8,"Sure, I'm appreciative that the officials allowed it to be an aggressive game and they allowed big, physical contact to happen."
7.184711,5.280034,7,"  Well, you know, I don't think I was consciously thinking about the game at that time, but you pick up things if you're an independent kid."
6.518228,7.284416,7," We have world No. 1, Annika Sorenstam, the recent winner of the U.S. Women's Open and also the lady who won here in 2003.  There must be some good memories you have here."
6.124101,4.8450923,5,"  Well, start off with our Captain, Sue Bird, just leading us and it goes from the starting five all the way down to the players on the bench as well."
8.728072,5.8546977,7,"  I'm sure she is.  They're both great.  Pat was a pod captain last year too so I got to know her pretty well.  Yeah, they're both just great."
8.054333,4.7948966,8,I don't know that it's been a bit of a struggle and I think some of what's been identified as a struggle is explosive displays compared to what some of our Teams have done in the past.
7.3145056,6.280157,8,"Yes, we missed him in the first half and any conversations I have with him on whether he's coming back or what he's doing I will share with him and probably not anybody in here."
6.6630435,5.0497108,1,Today I went to the net a lot.  I felt very good.  There are going to be players where I am going to have to come in more.  I am working on that.  It is much better.
5.6368814,4.395216,6,"  You know, weather is really good and golf course is really good condition right now, so everybody -- I know everybody play well starting weekend, right?"
8.794032,6.7558136,7," I think size-wise, they compare to Nebraska close enough, their center is about the same size, the way their tackles would be, physical.  Just the quickness of the center, I'd say probably the most they compare to is Nebraska."
5.475187,3.818858,7,"  Lopez?  Yeah, I've faced him plenty of times, yeah, when he was with the Indians and this year with the Devil Rays.  He's a pitcher that comes right at you and I was looking to get at it right away."
8.902085,6.6560316,5,"We have a really good Team. We have a lot of good things going. We have -- we're trying to build the 2020 Team. Our energy's been spent on that. Obviously, it's been a different off-season for us."
9.387195,6.377465,7,"  Well, there's not uncertainty in my mind with LeBron James.  And [when] I took the job, we didn't have Anthony Davis.  We didn't have the whole Team.  It was a different Team after the fact."
6.1299005,5.1934257,2," I think it's just work has been paying off and I did good last year, I just didn't have any wins.  But I was playing good."
7.3607125,4.5852804,1,There's no doubt there's been a lot more time going into data and watching games. And there's so much footage now these days that you can't really hide.
8.32218,4.550877,2," Yeah, sure, she was.  She was making some doublefaults or easy volley mistakes and -- I mean, she is always a little bit nervous when it is getting close.  Yeah, she was, definitely."
8.528399,5.8016405,4,"Look, we know we're a great fielding unit. We normally have one of those games somewhere along the line. I'm just happy it's gone now, and I know the Team is going to do better next time."
5.8248205,2.2287624,2,"But Yadi can hit anywhere. Hit second for us, third, fourth, fifth. He can hit anywhere because Yadi has an approach, and so he's going to be productive."
5.480718,6.8651934,5,I'm living the dream. I know this is a big opportunity for me. It's a big year for me. And I'm going to do my best every outing and enjoy the time.
6.7546353,3.4735446,5,Feel really good.  I was just thinking like I don't want to discredit my round just because I played a couple bad holes towards the end of the day.
8.6027975,6.944146,8,"I thought we were disciplined. We weren't trying to do so much. I think when we've gone back and we watch how we defended her in the past, I thought it looked like a very undisciplined, poor-coached Team."
9.4298525,4.7136984,6,"  I mean, it definitely is a high percentage if I have a few days.  But like I said, I'm making some progress, then some days I'm the same.  We'll see.  We'll see."
7.798996,3.9577296,2,Just I think my game just is finally coming together.  I'm really comfortable my swing.  My PXG equipment has been working fantastic for me.
7.111318,5.559445,4,"Yeah, it definitely helps when you can get -- see their bullpen. This way you know in a long series like that you know who you're going to face, if you face them again, and what they have."
6.8733463,4.930269,4,"Yeah, I talked to him a little bit in Houston. A lot of guys who I've played with, we've gone through a couple of levels here and being able to play against somebody else, it's great."
6.106643,2.361761,2,"I started on 1, so first hole I hit a sand wedge about a foot, got it in my range.  I hit a 9-iron about two feet."
7.8937926,6.391242,5,"No, we're trying to win today's game. I'll empty my own tank. There's certainly a couple of guys that I'm not going to use; Greinke and Cole. But we're trying to win today's game."
5.742138,3.8260949,1,I know what the boards feel like (laughter).  I was a little bit confused where he was.  It was six-on-five.  You're just trying to find a spot to stand.  I was tired so I parked it in front.
8.32346,6.239115,7,"To talk about what Matt was saying and his lacrosse IQ, it was in the fall last year, it was freshmen fall."
7.6056848,7.1521845,7,"Every off-season we go through our baseball operations policies. Sign stealing was a big focus during the off-season last year, and I expect it will be this year as well."
5.0177755,5.9662437,3,"Yeah, he's in the clubhouse now. He's going to get treatment. He's going to do everything he can to try to get ready."
7.1064777,3.602506,4," I have played Sampras at Wimbledon this year, and that was a big match for me.  I didn't play too bad.  I played a few other guys."
5.585332,6.7830853,7,"It's amazing to see.  This is a hockey town.  They've been with us through the ups and downs.  They're excited.  This is something new and special, and they're a big part of it, a big piece of it."
7.7572865,4.832354,8,I think you heard Erik say in the previous interview there would probably be even more wrecks. We certainly don't need more wrecks than what we saw today. Probably not.
5.220312,5.4526424,5,I think everybody is excited about the game.  They have enjoyed their experience and they are going to be ready to play.
7.609764,5.2414193,8,"I think you're always looking for pitching. I don't know that you ever have enough. I don't know. We'll see what's out there, see whatever. But like I say, I don't think you can ever have enough starting pitchers."
7.4665313,2.872166,5,"It's a little different than our old stadium, it's got some jagged edges around the outfield. It's going to take some time."
6.7382402,4.261928,7, You probably are not going to see us two doing a Stance Little League Clinic.  We are probably the two worst guys you would want to have your kids going up there and hitting like.  (Laughter.)
6.423272,4.3181224,5,"Yeah, I mean, of course you want to win every game.  I think if you think you're going to sweep every Team or the games that are left, I think you're maybe in a fantasy world."
8.763746,5.7210484,2,"It would be great for us, great for the Team, great for him.  He's locked in, laser like focus going into this ballgame and practicing well, preparing really well.  Not going to let himself get beat in this game."
7.4900823,3.353484,7,"  Yes.  Definitely got a lot of congratulations from Mike Whan, for example.  He texted me right after the third round last week, so that felt really special."
7.8404536,4.5605083,1,"  So I been working more on like short game and bunker play and putting as well.  Putting obviously has been paying off.  Short game, not so much so far.  That can change this week."
8.155768,6.7094584,7,I've been texting him. We've been trying to call and missing each other. He's been hunting in Ohio and somewhere else.
5.9636364,6.111214,6," No, I actually got a wild card.  I received an invitation to play Doral as kind of a home player, I live only an hour north of Doral."
5.557302,5.878401,6,We had three-hour training camp practice yesterday (laughing).  It's just prep.  Normal prep in between games.  Our guys are ready.
6.7360344,5.304741,7,  Have you ever played in a tournament and the location was so beautiful that you decided to come back for a vacation?  Is Lake Oconee going to be one of your new vacation spots?
5.2526226,5.3328657,5,"Maybe a chip. I think when you play some of the Teams we play in our division so much, it's probably best not to seen think about it. Using it as ray positive or a negative, just go play."
8.326799,3.8679142,3, He was -- it was his back because I saw him in the locker room it was his back.  Which probably coming from the serve.
5.958999,5.9377246,2," We have by far and away the No. 1 player from the Ladies European Tour, Gwladys Nocera.  You've won three times and you're obviously got to be fairly confident coming in."
8.857316,6.3482685,4,"  Yeah, again, we're our own worst enemy sometimes.  Our turnovers tonight really hurt us badly, unforced turnovers.  We're in a good position.  They're a very fine basketball Team and you can't make those kind of blunders against them."
7.4155297,4.743587,7,"  Well, you know, you're cooking for yourself, paying for your own school.  So you're not living high on the hog, I guess you could say."
6.304886,5.554423,5,"It means a lot.  We're lucky to have them.  They've been here for us all year, before that, too.  You look to them, can feel comfort in that, follow in their footsteps, know you're walking in the right direction."
8.277846,2.9311614,4,"  Yeah, I was just pushing.  I was hustling the car, driving as hard as I could, trying to enjoy myself.  I really enjoyed the race conditions, love driving a full race.  It's my favorite part of the weekend."
6.326187,2.4832807,4,"  One was sand wedge, and one was my fat baby, 60-degree lob-wedge.  Usually I use that one mostly around the green and in the heavy stuff.  It just came out a little strong."
5.893171,6.5271816,4," I thought that if I play my best I know that there is a possibility to win, so it wasn't a big surprise for me."
5.8616085,5.500779,2,"  Those guys do a great job.  I don't think the height is a key thing.  I think, again, we've just got to make plays."
8.034987,7.1301775,7,"The meetings will probably get longer because he won't get up and leave after he gets bored. Definitely lose some entertainment value, for sure. "
5.2973914,3.8908389,1,"So a part of our tactics are bowling according to stumps, stump to stump. That's the field we employ. But we did not hit those lengths or those lines. Yeah, it just wasn't working for us today."
8.774527,2.9771583,7," I've got a bunch of family in town, so I'll probably just be at home and entertain all of the family that I've got in town."
8.740168,5.2498612,4, It was the same thing last week at Evian.  But I guess that's what we call experience and hopefully I will get that one day and I won't be so stressed in front of these girls.
6.3384104,4.9818425,4," No, it was very tough today because it is true, somewhere I have to beat Masur because his ranking is less than mine, and I beat Courier and everybody wait, I am winning, so it was very difficult today."
7.894308,4.930547,7," I don't know.  I hope so, but I am not working with the French Federation, so I think my coach will be very happy."
6.108346,7.214893,5,"I think the biggest thing was we went out there, and we're trying to have so much fun. And you'll sit back and review what you're doing, and you get to play the game with the people you love."
7.3454967,5.2126713,7,"My opinion really doesn't matter, so I don't normally give it.  Say what I say, so I'm not going to give my opinion."
6.3537307,3.985434,5,"Again, I think it brought us together, kind of similar to this game, like we're in this, and when we can turn it on, it's dangerous."
7.008898,3.737458,4," It is not nice.  It is not nice.  It needs to be get better, everyone wants it to be better, but I don't think we have enough power, I don't think we have right people to change it."
5.9980392,3.0992754,3," Well, I thought it was    to me, the holes played, the into the winds holes I did better on those I think because you can control your ball.  Just wherever it landed, it was going to stay."
9.140031,6.441631,4,"No, today we made mistakes in fielding and dropped some catches. That's the difference between our Team and the England Team."
5.346924,6.0977526,2," I'm not too concerned.  I don't really look around the stadium to see who's watching or how many people are there, I try to keep myself focused-- what was the question exactly?"
5.6062093,4.0493493,2,"  I'm in great shape.  I bounce back extremely well in between games.  I could play right now if we had to play right now, at a high level."
6.2031965,5.8581405,5," Yeah. I mean, it helps a lot just to look to the side and see that you have people there who are with you, and you know it gives you some strength and it makes you feel good."
7.377577,2.3154502,1," That means playing on the baseline and finishing the point with the winner, with the volley or something.  So the points will be longer than they were today.  And that will take a lot of mental concentration."
6.209755,3.7439914,4,"No, it was never like that.  Every week I felt like I could win because my practice was so good."
5.9661736,2.4365675,4," Yes.  Birdie on 4, on 4 I hit a 3-wood off the tee and I hit a 6-iron in there about 12 feet just below the hole and made that for birdie."
6.8401413,6.1928334,2,"Well, I remember him hitting against me in Spring Training. And I would expect him to be looking for a fastball after the first at-bat."
7.6351213,3.3195832,7," Alicone (ph).  His birthday is today.  Yesterday he was joking, ""You're just waiting for a good round tomorrow, it's my birthday.""  So, I'm glad.  He's been my coach for a long time."
5.8231235,3.5368106,5,"Yeah, I think it gives negative mojo to your Team if you think of how many goals you're down by.  Instead we take it, like I said earlier, play-by-play.  I think that's what got us out of that hole."
6.1970973,6.7121267,2,"It's something that I have done. It's something -- it has to be the right time situationally when you are talking about a player, whether it's your player or someone that potentially can come play for you."
7.2638,6.7731824,1," No.  I just work on everything the same for three years now with my new coach.  So the same every day, like a magician that works on his piano, so it's the same, work, work, would."
6.8488874,5.8622017,2,I think just what I expect out of him.  I know he's a goal-scorer.  He scores lots of goals every year.  But there's a lot more to his game than that.  I think that needed to come out.
5.90835,5.0108094,4," Of course.  Yeah, to beat Becker in a Grand Slam that he won before, it is just great. Nothing compares to this, for sure."
5.440969,5.441147,1," I don't think there will be an effect, because they have other players, as well.  So we can't just go in there saying, we have to play different, we're going to play the same way."
7.1830235,4.066722,5,"Yeah, it's just the game management, and you're expecting -- I'm not going to go all into it, but I have confidence, I had confidence in Kenley."
8.780371,4.8516517,4,"  Yeah, 100%.  I was not happy about that.  I was not happy.  But the bunkers are usually -- I like bunkers a lot so I just kind of went, No."
6.182081,5.2143717,5,"Yeah, you're going to see Teams doing some uncharacteristic things just because they know their season's on the line, they'll give everything they've got. We have to be patient and ready to respond to whatever they throw at us."
7.9003296,3.7315133,2," I think she is a great player and she really puts a lot in the game on the court and off the court.  I hope she is still around for quite a few more years, at least."
7.277102,2.2490487,4," It was only two feet wide.  First point he served for it.  It is a huge point, and it just pissed me off.  I had just got into it from there on."
7.009983,2.4769294,2," Well, it is best she has played for a while.  She has a tendency to do that against me. Bad luck."
6.8925753,4.3587785,7,"For sure. I had a pretty good familiarity with the National League West, not just as the manager of the Giants, but also coming to play in the National League West as the manager of the Phillies."
7.832327,3.861059,2,"Yeah, we stopped the bleeding last night and then came out and played well again today. We want to just keep it rolling."
7.1903667,6.394973,3," Yes, I did.  And they did some work on it.  They gave me some medication and so on and so on.  But not good enough."
7.471884,6.365642,1,"We knew Ohio State was going to come out aggressive in that second half, just like they normally do.  We wanted to continue to be aggressive from our part."
5.949381,3.9370534,2," The best way I can describe it is that this kind of golf suits my game.  Like for instance, at the U.S. Open, I fared okay, but I never had great finishes."
8.723191,7.0583525,4,"We can be better, period.  I thought we were good in front of them.  A couple of bad breakdowns we didn't capitalize on.  I thought we were solid in terms of the overall play, Team defense."
7.6151295,5.440358,7," Twice.  I played Tuesday, I was in the Pro Am, but before I got to here, I played Friday and Saturday, that was it."
7.6361504,2.67255,8,"So they've got to qualify now to make it.  Every now and then that's going to happen, but it seems to be happening more and more in the Ryder Cup."
5.9227595,4.0923843,7,  This golf course is beautiful.  I've never been in area so it's a really pleasant surprise.  It's just so cool seeing all the boats.  People are actually allowed to see us I guess on the boats.
4.888618,5.9728947,5,"No, we try not to worry about any of that.  We just try to go out there and do our jobs and play."
7.1033072,5.4195905,7,"I think we've come a long way, as we have really over the course of decades.  I think the league is in a bigger, better, stronger place.  That starts with the product on the ice."
6.4743943,3.3439565,7,It could be. I'm not a big room service guy. I like to go out and eat. Houston has got some pretty good restaurants that I like.
5.764596,5.020967,2," I think it is hardcourt.  I mean, even though he won his first Slam on the clay, I think hardcourt has had his best results."
7.004393,6.028454,7,I can share that I've been a fan of both players for a long time. I can share that in Philadelphia we thought about Kevin quite a bit. And we were fans then; I'm still a fan today.
7.6835394,4.954844,6,"  I mean, I'm doing everything what I can do.  It does feel better than when it happened.  But you know, we'll see.  I mean, I don't have no timetable yet."
6.512157,6.8240056,8,"  No, I've always been a guy who kind of let his game do the talking.  But when guys get to talking, I can do that, as well.  I've always tried to let my game do the talking."
6.421873,5.2959676,8," We asked for a wildcard, three, four weeks ago, maybe.  I decided to play New Haven and Schenectady and here and asked for wildcards in all three."
5.7159653,3.378773,4," You got off to a very fast start, two birdies in the first two holes, would you like to talk about that?"
7.930278,2.6409912,4," I kind of enjoyed it.  I didn't enjoy the fourth set.  Did not enjoy that at all.  I enjoyed the match.  I enjoyed the first three sets, but I'd like to go out and do that fourth set again."
7.229944,5.3864255,7,"We have it on the outside of the case packs for our own uses that we know. That's part of the recommendation, is to better develop a tracking mechanism all the way through."
5.6539044,5.4787884,4," Yeah, I think we start to play very nervous.  We didn't play so good today, but I think we have a great job in this tournament and I hope next year we are going to win the tournament."
7.688922,6.7201676,5,"I echo everything. If we look too far ahead, we get lost. Even taking it one point at a time, we're not looking too far ahead or in the past, we're just focused on the here and the now."
4.5480375,4.5154037,4,"Absolutely. That's what you call a perfect pitch right there, a pitcher's pitch. And I was able to lay it off. I thought it was a little off. I haven't seen a replay of that pitch."
6.9025393,4.243135,2,"  Yeah, probably.  They have a deeper bench, there's no question and I think that gives them more of an advantage over the other National League clubs."
8.691973,5.241686,8," I am not in her position.  I am in the other position.  I would probably continue, so, I don't know."
9.228536,6.0015106,2,"  Yeah.  I mean, that's who I am.  I know it doesn't seem like that all the time, but that's how I want to be on the court for this Team, be aggressive, take my shots, and just be myself."
6.522203,6.304119,2,"We talked about it right after that. These guys all season long, offense comes and goes, you have slumps, but when they're clicking on all cylinders, it's pretty special to watch."
7.78059,5.332366,5,I don't know the Team sentiment. We haven't really discussed it all that much. We're worried about winning a baseball game.
9.217199,6.547378,4,"Yeah, I think both Teams were pretty consistent throughout the match. Like hue said, Florida is a good Team, and not just people be consistent, but just one set was towards one Team and one set was towards the other."
8.016186,4.2049093,7,Yes. He's been to many of the events that I've done in Puerto Rico. He helped support my academy in Puerto Rico. He's a very good friend.
8.627027,3.6719427,1,"  A couple times.  She forced me into 3-wood a couple of times and it was a good move.  I wanted to hit driver and she's like, ""You can't do that."""
6.5846734,4.527915,4,"Yeah, we were actually down 3 games to 1. We won the game in Chicago and then went to Cleveland and won the next two."
5.9245424,2.3016624,3,He's good. He's been swinging. I don't think he's hit live yet. He's hit off the tee. He says he feels good. Everything is healthy.
7.6181264,5.3110538,7," I don't even know, maybe at the Bob Hope, and that's it.  Of course they have  thin air, as well.  At sea level I don't know."
5.9899964,3.488277,4," Most of the time you know it right away.  It is dramatic.  You win, you feel like you are on the top of the world and you lose and you feel like I am right now."
9.3048525,3.9521177,5,"He basically summed up everything.  It's just been an amazing three years for me.  Denver took me in as one of their own, and I can't thank them enough for doing that."
6.976983,3.2932866,2,"Those are pretty nice numbers for a middle, .484, 19 kills, eight blocks. And then got three aces, got some service. That's a pretty nice night."
7.110158,6.056623,2,Probably more.  It's his first Playoff.  He's a young guy.  We didn't know what to expect.  He's grown his game.
7.732458,3.657423,8,"Well, the three-batter minimum for me is a little cloudy, so I'm waiting to get some more clarification on it."
5.291784,4.6749578,4," I wanted to come    I knew that the back nine would be hard to play, or harder, so I really wanted to make a good start, and I got it with the birdie on 1."
7.827374,5.5312357,2,That's yet to be determined. I don't know if he played much baseball. We're going to find out just how much.
7.7870884,4.1932726,3," I had no idea.  I mean, until he said-- until he went up to the umpire's chair I had no idea he was injured."
7.872972,6.3006735,5,"We are from a cricket crazy nation, so, yeah, people are expecting from us to win, and we are going also for the win actually."
8.059914,6.6455703,6,"Just trying to get better. We've been fortunate to get to the Round of 8 the last couple years. That's kind of been our stopping point. For us, we're just eyes ahead trying to assert ourselves amongst that next group."
6.80377,5.044456,5,"It's tough having to think about different games, especially in the Playoffs.  I think we've done a good job as a group just taking games, putting them behind us when need to be, just focusing on the next one."
8.157495,2.7522395,7,We're really excited to be here in Pittsburgh. We've enjoyed our time here. Been here since Monday. It's been really cool to be able to take a look at some of this city.
7.429815,5.7227345,2,"Yeah, I don't know if I came into his first year here shooting for 150. I think days off are important for players, period, of his age specifically, and we'll do our best to get it."
7.5864453,5.399054,2," I don't know, he played okay, so good. I didn't have a lot of chances.  I was always behind.  I don't know, I think he played much better than me first two sets."
6.817199,2.977473,4,"A little bit, yeah. I think there's two different situations; one was with two outs, one was with one out. The one today I was trying to get the ball in the air and just drive in a run."
9.578433,4.986237,5,"  I'm blessed.  I'm blessed to be there.  I'm grateful.  But at the end of the day that's good and all, but I'm here trying to compete for something bigger than that."
5.5302343,5.6951785,5,"I think they're excited. I think part of the excitement is, when you hear how things are going to be adjusted or different, but the main part of my job is following through on that."
6.0117707,3.9500902,1,I think all of his meetings are pretty similar.  It always ends with  Do the obvious things right.
5.4264984,2.4205348,2,"Yeah, the innings started well and Javeria played well, and we had some more partnerships. I'm trying the best, and I tried to hit the ball and get the maximum score."
6.5482283,5.8245306,2,"Sevi is another guy that really improved his defense over the course of the year. Always a catch first, throw, bat second guy, and swung the bat well for us, especially against left-handed pitching."
7.6533136,4.926654,2," Well, if she -- it is hard to tell.  I mean, if she keeps playing as well as she does, maybe.  But you never know."
4.5132685,4.4567823,1,"For sure. Oh, yeah. Let me give you an example. I bring in Thomas Hardy to pitch the seventh inning."
8.406203,2.9028463,7,"I've got some friends up here and my parents are driving up tonight.  My brother lives in D.C., so not too far away."
7.788237,6.572272,8,Absolutely not. Absolutely not. This is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing.
5.5541053,2.776297,5,"  ""Don't lose.""  He was pretty simple about stuff like that.  The ball is in my hand and I have control of my own destiny tomorrow."
7.5836487,5.2995524,4," I don't really know, you know, what was going through his head.  He played a good game to break me.  And then, you know, just didn't convert there.  Hard to say what happened, really."
6.98794,2.6170475,6,"  We took some time off yesterday just to kind of get away from it a little bit, and we reconvened today, met, watched film, went over some stuff, practiced, got some work in, and we're all ready for tomorrow."
5.2974615,4.638509,7," Yeah, I kind of felt like you know, the crowd was for me and you know, it is a good feeling to have and to know that the crowd is there with you and supporting you."
8.085591,5.791508,2,"I agree, I think it's a great recognition for her and for her Teammates. Obviously you don't get to be a First Team All-American unless you've got some pretty quality people around you. So, yeah, I agree with you there."
5.329153,6.6874585,7,  Not very big.  We had three people living in one and two people in two other rooms.  I had a single which was about as big as this box I'm standing on right now.
6.4641194,5.873812,5,"I think he does a good job of keeping himself in the mix.  He's that type of guy that, yeah, he's around now, comes out to the skates, hangs out with the guys."
8.945027,5.31218,2, We have Karrie Webb here.  She comes into this tournament having won last week at Evian and in very good form considering she's won twice this year.
5.213355,6.4728417,7,Absolutely.  It's exceeded our expectations.  When you get down here in this weather and the hospitality of Hillsborough County and Tampa people and the Outback Bowl people has been awesome.
7.1418095,6.7679763,1,Can we talk about that after a few cocktails? (Chuckles.) There was a lot of conversation about that three-batters. We've got a lot of managers still trying to figure out how it's going to work out.
7.7690945,4.2013297,7," Ask her what she means.  I mean, hanging out for me is just being home and play tennis one day and golf the same day, maybe just take care of my family."
8.7771845,5.9012966,5,I think the future is bright for this organization. I know Jeff is not only planning to be good for two or three years; he is planning for the Team to be great for a long time.
9.491811,5.791737,5,"That's what you live for. For me, I need to get in my pregame routine right now, and that's where I'm at mentally, here we go."
5.646328,7.1099014,7," I was sleeping also.  And taking a lot of showers, because you sweating just walking on the street.  I sweat.  Taking showers; then eat spaghetti and go to bed."
6.837436,5.6688304,5,I just think it's going to be easier this year because I know the players so much and I know -- I'm familiar with a lot of guys.
7.651192,4.8421607,2," I don't think so, no.  I wasn't very happy with my game today, so I don't know.  I didn't do anything better --"
6.153327,4.3111596,7," Just have to read Brad Gilbert's book then you know everything.  You need to read his book, then you know everything."
9.326441,3.8685598,7,"Congratulations, Marcus; Yordan, thank you for coming; Yasmani Grandal, Xander, Kirby, thank you for being here. Another round of applause for the All-MLB Teams presented bu Scotts."
5.068923,6.0997624,6,I think we're going to come out tomorrow and try to apply pressure. When we play our best baseball we apply pressure.
7.25521,5.0667996,7,"Yeah, but to what extent, we didn't know to what extent. But, yeah, we were trying to take some precautions, yes."
8.187118,5.1558237,3,  I'm not going to get into all of those because I don't know all of them.  I'll just be in there at the end.  But that's the training staff and our doctor will be involved in that.
7.3140764,6.8696966,4,"Yeah. Actually, we think the first one is edge, but unfortunately, we lost the review, and the second one is out, I think, but we lost the review."
7.1392813,5.431771,1,  I don't know that Will is going to be able to help us do anything when we're sitting eighth.  That's just the way it goes.
7.0228305,7.07704,2,Am I a fan? I love it when my pitchers get three hitters out in a row. I think that's the greatest thing in the world. How do you like that answer?
7.2191863,3.9284909,4,"National championship over everything.  This is an amazing experience.  We really came out today, and I feel like we played all four quarters, and that's something we really struggled with in the playoffs."
6.161269,7.1608553,4,"If you were to use this week's current rankings, pre British Open, and apply the new 35 divisor, I believe Michelle would now be ranked seventh."
7.444709,3.9261637,2,"I think everybody needs a little bit of confidence. You can't go out there not having any. If it's your day, it's your day. You have to cash in."
8.415477,4.2212353,2,He's extremely smart. He can move the ball around. He changes speeds from 90-plus to 70 and below. That's not easy to do. That's not easy to face.
7.48106,5.8065624,2,"It's just a great group of guys and they played so well, and they were just flying all over, and that was a very good offense.  It was just a treat to be able to be with them."
6.5153728,5.9256454,5,I think it helps our players knowing that they got a chance to play here for a couple of days. They know the environment. They know the field. And I think that definitely helps them out a lot.
5.4006157,4.979757,7,"That's an inside joke. Tommy and I have spoken a lot, as much as anybody I've spoken with has been Tommy. Well, I will get to everybody."
7.2246003,5.0355673,4,"  I don't think ever in a major  -- to be in contention, I don't think we've ever been in the final group on the last day."
7.2453256,5.969591,8, You don't deserve to take my money.  I deserve to take your money because I help you do your job.
9.375015,3.9382827,7,"Jenna Gray, setter, Stanford volleyball. Not a question. But just wanted to apologize for all of the times I made fun of you over the years and just say thank you for an incredible time. So thank you very much."
8.557338,5.771467,7," It is great.  It is a great city for sure.  You can see some real life and you know, since we only playing small places, being in New York for two weeks is great."
6.00925,2.189702,2," When I first hit it, I had no idea whether it was going to go out, but once it goes out, it's a pretty special feeling.  I've never hit a walk-off home run before so it was a special experience."
9.572747,4.873849,7," That's true.  I'm always afraid I'm going to get shot because somebody thinks I'm Brad.  I need a sign on my back that says I'm Bart, don't shoot me."
9.135033,4.100209,5,It's the first time we've ever achieved that in our 27-year history.  Obviously we're excluding the time when we were the sole manufacturer.
9.501519,5.1214995,5,"I'm just looking forward to work with these kids again. That's my mindset. I'm very lucky to have the Team that I have. What's the oldest guy, Anthony Alford? He's got the most time, I think."
8.295761,4.739867,5,"Yeah.  It's like -- I mean, the goal is to get back and win it, though.  We're not satisfied with getting here.  But definitely just to get back here, we don't really accept anything less."
9.474761,5.8741307,5,  No one on this Team cares about Individual awards.  Not something that anyone needs to be concerned about.  That's the ultimate goal.  That's what we set out to do at the beginning of the year.
5.2804446,6.0353045,5,"Griff Thompson, Will Hudson and Patrick Burkinshaw are like three of my best friends on the Team.  It's a community, and it's just amazing to get to hang out with them every day."
6.9253874,3.3187368,7,"Thanks very much, Ted. If you would like to ask a question, raise your hand and wait for a microphone. We encourage you to ask questions during this availability portion."
6.8908234,3.9864283,5,"I hope so. I hope so. I'm AOK with being the underdog. Kind of been there for most of my career. I've fine with that, doesn't bother me a bit. "
8.636511,5.8652005,2,"Well, that line, when they're all together, they have great chemistry for sure.  That line will be more effective, I would assume, with Barbashev back.  He's probably our most physical player up front."
4.69884,4.67552,5,"Through text chains, different things like that.  We obviously see him when we're at home.  Chris Wagner has been on the road with us, he's been able to travel, but Kevan not so much."
7.5603766,6.40105,1,"Yeah, I think especially early on, being in their building, it's something that we can certainly do.  It's going to be effective.  It worked for us here in the series.  I expect a more physical game from both sides."
5.1590595,5.1464353,4,"  We approach every game with that mindset.  We want to be the Team that gets the first loose ball, makes the first physicality play, makes the first hustle play, all those types of things."
7.302313,3.250593,1,"  We have Batista listed on the bullpen card today, but it is strictly in an emergency situation that he would be used out there."
8.176444,3.9553373,7,  After I came into the room and I saw today I didn't know if it was me seeing him or him lying down on that bench there.
7.8527,7.1963434,7,"I found out from Alex Bregman, by the way, which is part of the story. I forget to answer the first part of your question. Go ahead."
5.8469133,6.4216633,4,I'm not too sure what really happened.  It just happened so fast.  But the officials did a tremendous job in our game.  So I trust the decision made by the officials.
5.5702605,3.759787,4, It broke left to right and at the end it came back and it was coming back right to left at the end and it ended up going in right in the middle.
7.517687,2.35365,7,"At what point does she stop becoming the transfer from Michigan? That was three years ago. She's Tiffany Clark, Wisconsin Badger."
5.5580864,3.6563096,4, It is the same.  It is fast.  Just fast.  You can't say it is two miles slower or something.  It is just fast.
5.855532,3.0128586,4,"On the 10th tee I put it in the rough but made a bogey there, but on the next hole I made a birdie, and I think that was the key hole maybe."
8.222437,5.03086,2,"I thought I did fine. I don't know, I'm just playing to win. I guess that's the key to my performance."
6.8440356,6.3470073,8,"""Don't you think you had a moral obligation to the British fans to let them see the greatest player in the world?""  No, this is not an exhibition.  This guy came on and on and on."
8.267415,4.786784,2,"Yeah, I don't know if they're really slowing him down.  I think he's getting looks.  He's just not scoring.  Rask is playing well, that's for sure, making the saves."
5.882652,6.3797727,5,"We trust our players here. You hear a lot of people like me sit up here and say that, We trust our players, and give them the opportunity."
5.4158807,3.8308349,1,"Yeah, the coaches always emphasise on bowling on the right place and right spot and right length and line and length."
7.945023,5.5768566,5,"That's a tough call. I haven't even looked at schedule yet, but I know we play good baseball, and we got to stay healthy, but I think we're better than what people think, that's for sure."
8.008528,4.4194674,7,"Something we did as an organization is we sent a group of professionals to Puerto Rico to work with him in different areas, training areas, and he was very receptive with all the information."
7.854424,4.4975824,5,"No, I'm a genuine guy, and it's really easy in this game, especially players. They see through the people that are fake or BS. I don't think that will be a problem for me."
6.707925,4.0835395,2,"Today was a much better day, yeah.  Eight birdies and felt great out there.  Nice to post a 65 up there and try and catch some of the leaders."
7.355939,4.6797137,1," I prefer to leave it a secret because I'd like it to be working for me for more and more weeks and months and years, so I am not going to tell you that.  Sorry."
5.9029546,4.9722714,4,They didn't win 106 games for nothing. They'll really good. They've got a well-balanced lineup. Their pitching is good. Their bullpen gets out. We knew this coming in.
8.529331,7.208903,2,"We're very pleased with the way he played. Obviously, the errors aren't part of the equation, but when you start looking at metrics and what he does range-wise, he's very solid. He's very solid."
9.04331,5.4139323,5,"We're happy to be back at the Final Four. Excited for our match on Thursday. Been a great year for us, and wonderful to be playing some of the best volleyball here at the end."
6.5381584,7.067136,3,"No, no. We have not. And I think it's probably something he would be open to. We have started talking about a little bit, but right now we have a focus on getting healthy and working hard at third base."
5.7806144,5.46827,2, I- wasn't- worried about the other guys in the draw.  Just concerned about my matches and what I was going to do to prepare and stay focused.  Last two weeks I did a pretty good job of that.
7.6356583,4.473159,7,"It's about seven, eight hours.  I'd skip school on Friday and go down.  I missed my fair days of school."
7.1330857,5.9217873,2," Well, sure she's a great player.  She has been at the top before, and, you know, she knows how to win and, you know, there is no question.  I think she plays -- is it Graf?"
5.3607,2.629622,1,It's just tactically just to break the momentum because she was getting bat on ball and just to slow the game down for us as well.
9.167187,4.264777,7," Yeah, first time.  Sometimes they defaulted at the beginning of the tournament, but not beginning so close to the quarterfinals or semifinals.  It is the first time."
5.980674,5.9252615,7,"  Yeah, it's actually a good influx of really good people.  It will just help on the engineering side of things.  Obviously you've got a bigger crew to pick from as far as crews."
8.853317,4.950276,7,"  I happy to be in that position.  I am not thinking about if I am surprised or not.  I am very, very happy."
8.247488,6.6844287,7,"  Interestingly enough, it's never like this day of decision.  I just kind of start working out and I see how I feel.  I wish I could give you more, and I'm not trying to be elusive."
7.398472,6.493871,2," Yeah, I mean, I worked also a lot my physical, so I know I have now maybe one of the best also."
5.246045,2.5103493,2,"No, that's where the ball went. As soon as I try to premeditate, I usually lose my wicket. So I have a saying, see ball hit ball, and that's something that I did today."
4.757407,5.357831,2,"Yeah, of course it's a worry. I think any Team worries when their senior players aren't performing. Obviously there are things that we can go back and look at, but obviously that hurts."
6.9111037,5.736185,1,"That is extremely important for us in offense.  To be as successful as we need to be, we need to have both parts of our game going, and, you know, January 3rd, we intend to have a great time."
8.071649,7.111223,1,"I'm not sure what the answer to that question is. The most direct and easiest way to answer is probably to win more baseball games, and how many more? I'm not quite sure."
4.9126463,6.0279245,7," Well, what can you do when you have a rain like that?  There is not much you can do and when you want to stick to the schedule, it is what you try to did, just hope for the best."
9.085026,4.1729994,7,I put that out of my mind a long time ago.  I could have sat in my den a lot of times and gotten mad at Trey for that ridiculous drop on Sunday.
5.0834775,4.469294,4,Do you want to go through the birdies first and then he can make some comments?  You started on 10 and you birdied 11.
7.3038797,3.7240689,6,"Doesn't look like there is one right now, but I hope there's one tomorrow. We're waiting until the last game to have it on our side."
7.687148,4.6129165,7,"  I did.  Probably had a small piece last night, too.  I have had a couple of pieces since we cut it.  Don't tell my (indiscernible)."
7.8015327,2.7555416,1,  It's been good.  We got to enjoy some experiences that we don't see happen very often; so enjoy them when they do happen.  But also prepare yourself to play a great game.
6.927488,3.1217148,2," The forehand, the backhand, I already had it.  I have a forehand and two hand backhand.  Two hand backhand and it is difficult to say, like this (Indicating) I don't know.  When she hits she let's go with one hand."
8.71162,4.2847776,7," Well, I mean, I want to thank Laura, that's quite a compliment.  I mean, it's tough for me to think in    that's such a big compliment."
7.9176655,4.1176476,2," It was a little difficult to get into the court.  But it didn't take a lot of time to do that, the problem was with my game, it was the problem where I play."
7.175288,2.2590144,3," I just came in with a bad knee and it just started getting worse.  It was a bit painful to push off.  I had no strength to push off, so I didn't see any point of playing."
7.14378,2.8217638,7," Not anymore, as long as you have the right documentation it's not too bad.  But I didn't want to put her through that.  She's not quite a year old yet, so I didn't fancy that."
8.531866,6.3026366,6,"""Them"" being Stanford? Well, they're good. They were good then, and they're good now. We know we've got our work cut out for us. Very talented Team. Well coached, and we expect it to be a battle."
6.3167267,5.1012287,8,"Yeah, look, nothing has been decided yet, so it's tough to talk about when there is an investigation going on."
8.561611,4.9729342,2,"  I mean, obviously, all the experiences that he's had.  He's not going to get surprised by anything.  He's been in every competitive situation that this league can provide you and he's been able to find success with different Teams."
6.063363,5.3685927,4," Not yet, but maybe I will in a couple of years.  Today she had a good chance, because I wasn't playing very well.  She had a good chance to even win today.  She was trying to play very well."
6.271906,3.4022155,7,"I feel like I'd say what my mom always says about us when I ask who the favorite child is, and she was like, I don't have favorites, but I do like a certain one more at different times."
8.214009,3.034305,7,"  Karting?  I was going to race a club race next weekend but then I realized I'm testing a couple days after, so probably shouldn't risk it.  Yeah, I love the karting.  No Vegas this year, unfortunately.  They called that off."
5.0359125,6.033238,2," Yeah, I would like to reach the top.  I would like to be the best.  I try to keep improving and to keep changing things if I have to, just to get better and to be the best."
5.9960856,5.6179295,3,I think I am going to take about a month rest and let my knee heal and get ready for the tournaments in Europe.
5.467178,2.2980506,2,Ask him if he can speak as loud as when he hit the ball on the train so they can hear him back there. (Chuckles.)
6.394198,2.3105793,1," Hopefully there's somewhere I can do some sort of fix-up job, if I can get it somewhere near 55 degrees.  It's about the loft of my 5-iron at the moment."
7.9173803,6.2628694,2,"I finished tied for second, played well.  I was tied on the last day and I finished second, finished tied for second."
6.6156507,7.1665306,7," I just want it to be on the record so anybody upstairs and the writers that aren't here right now, talk a little bit about the match then being in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open."
9.329231,5.1357527,6,"  Well, if I'm playing with Karrie, I look forward to it.  She's obviously one of the greatest players on our tour ever, so I'm going to expect some good things from her tomorrow."
4.620088,4.728078,1,"Just different adjustments. Different adjustments to make, different pitches. And to be able to focus on any pitches in the zone, those were the basic things."
5.9729776,3.2994304,4," Oh, it's probably been -- I think maybe one of the holes in Reno, Nevada, I think I did it once there, and then a par from there at the Bob Hope earlier in the year."
9.079229,6.6115894,5,"It was a good feeling, especially after last year. Overall we're just glad that the Team did well and that we were very consistent."
6.670722,3.0833006,4," Six probably.  6 over through the first ten holes, at least four or five shots.  When that stuff happens, you've just got to"
6.54015,3.2970982,5,"Maybe even a little bit before. No, we all know who's going to potentially be available, so it was dialogue, conversations started up shortly thereafter."
7.9395103,6.085606,7,"How good we're going to be, our young core of players, what we've got going. That's the best sell I can do. I think it's a good one."
9.074162,5.8631783,4,"Yeah, so I didn't even know the 1 car had an engine issue. That's a bummer for sure. Our engine shop does a great job. Yeah, that's a bummer."
5.6802044,6.0161405,2,"didn't fire me up a whole lot. I look out every day I loved practice, even as a player, I"
8.275348,4.2145405,2," A little bit, but not very much.  I didn't change anything really; just very small things, you know, they were easy to change, to adjust."
8.89574,3.2391984,1,About four years ago.  I started using it midsummer and I've used the same putter ever since.  I've only changed the grip on it once.  I just was having some difficulties with my putting.  I love the long putter.
7.303358,4.451766,4,"We played a match without Madison Duello. She's kind of an important part of what we're doing. And it's really interesting of going back, like they said, and watching a match that you played, what, three months ago."
7.1904907,5.481857,2," I don't think so.  Not at all.  I know she is a good player, but all the other things have nothing to do you know, with the way I am going to play her."
6.887866,5.987048,2,"That's a great question. This year since Spring Training, him, Robles, and I have really come a long way, very long way. Spring Training was fun and interesting. How far we've come since then has been tremendous."
6.75105,3.1811683,7," Well, when you ask me that, I feel maybe a little bit bad for her now, but I feel more happy for myself, so it just overwhelms that."
6.6185613,4.5265145,6," Just looking forward to playing this game, because every  -- we've always dreamed of playing in this game, and we're doing everything we can to win the football game."
9.34722,5.9617915,5,I see where you're going.  That's not our motivation.  We're trying to compete for a title.  Golden State doesn't have anything to do with us.
7.1988597,3.7703483,1,That's a part of the coaching staff and what was evaluated of the situation and the nature of this tournament. So we wanted to bring her into the middle always to have her affect the game a bit more.
7.213891,4.7268066,4,I think I got -- I kind of just saved it when my ball striking wasn't there; when my putting wasn't there I saved it by the second putts.
8.708372,6.501393,6,"Yeah, Murshida is very young in the Team, and she has the potential to play well in the match. She's in good form nowadays, and I think she's going to be our best player in our Team."
7.1846757,5.500273,6,I don't know what the Nats fans are going to be like. I know they're going to be loud. I know it's going to be exciting here. They waited for a long time for this opportunity.
9.184095,5.226093,6,We're very happy to be here and excited to be competing in this phase of the tournament and looking forward to our match tomorrow. Thanks.
6.201645,4.4156704,1,"  Yeah, it was more just the read.  I had every intention to go with a rotation that we have been and possibly could go with that in Game 6."
7.8277493,7.2345805,7,"That's a really good question that I don't know exactly how to answer yet, specifically, because these are the types of things that I personally haven't spent a ton of time on."
6.6411023,3.3040316,1,"You know, we'll have these conversations all day. It's an exciting time. Our pitching will be mapped out a little bit, but honestly, we're just going to go with whatever we feel during the game."
5.8516192,3.6461701,5,"  No.  I mean, our backs are against the wall.  It's not like it's never been done before.  We still got hope, we are still going to grind to the end, start to finish."
5.438702,6.767356,2,"If I had to pick one weakness from AnÃ»?bal, it's hold the runners on. And we knew that. We tried different things. But he gets so focused on getting hitters out that sometimes he gets a little long."
6.1957345,2.5239224,4,"  Yeah, unfortunately I didn't hit that great of a shot on 11.  I feel like I executed my game plan, but we didn't carry it far enough for it to take that slope down."
7.1140933,5.6433086,4," I don't know why was that.  I have six chances to come in, I didn't come once, so that is the way."
7.086631,2.5461743,8," I could got a bad call, Bud.  Just long time out there to get a bad call on a big point."
6.040252,4.6479907,7,"  It means the world to me obviously that they're here.  This is the closest golf tournament that we have, and commish just added it to our schedule with COVID happening and canceling some events, having them here was just amazing."
5.319482,4.8298197,7,Just makes you feel good.  It makes you want to play harder and play better because it is also a good feeling that the crowd is enjoying the match and that they are getting into it too.
5.716825,5.0539155,4," I think it's just another loss.  I mean, we won six Grand Slams in a row.  How lucky do you want to be?"
5.6298738,4.3760614,2,"He's good. He threw, he felt good. We'll see what transpires between now and tonight. But he says he feels good. So, yeah, as of right now he'll definitely start Game 7."
7.631009,3.7356586,2,"I haven't yet spoken to Max today, waiting for him to get here. So hopefully he's a little bit better. We'll see and I'll talk to him and have more information sometime later today or tomorrow."
7.7856755,5.7955947,4,"Yeah, I think tonight they were really clean, yeah, I'd agree. And I thought we had some chances certainly in the second to maybe pull out a set here, and then it's hard to know."
6.679787,4.8318925,4,"I think we had a good season, the seniors stepped up and this was their last game and they played hard and I still think we had a good season even though we lost the last two games."
8.283119,6.407336,7,"No, I appreciate you saying that. But I'm not saying this trying to brag or trying to have any sense of overconfidence or anything like that."
5.2238274,2.6430793,7," I don't know, I signed the ball for a kid, so he might have had it because it was the same number.  Could have been that ball, I don't know."
6.101839,3.1479466,4,"  Honestly, today's round was a little bit boring.  I had 16 pars going into my last two holes, and pars are good, but they can be frustrating if you know you gave yourself a couple birdie chances."
5.459947,6.819396,2,"It's been huge. And like I said, everybody talks about our big three, but AnÃ»?bal has pitched unbelievable since he came off the aisle all year long. He gives us a chance to win ball games every outing."
9.339711,4.6492925,2,Status is still the same.  He went through the film session and that was the bulk of what we did.  Status is the same with Goran.
4.7323008,5.1096215,7,"I think everything has been pushed into the pile already. All these cars are pretty much prepared throughout the next three weeks, with the travel to Phoenix, Texas, back to Martinsville. Everything is already prepared."
5.4808598,5.7367277,2," Well, I didn't play my best, but I think a lot of that is due to what he was doing."
6.3722863,5.807263,5,"To be honest with you, I don't think many guys really think about the series in its entirety. I think more guys just try to have -- plan on going in and trying to accomplish the goal of winning today."
7.3951974,4.4448776,4,"No, we didn't have those conversations. Yeah, it was really just about getting the score today and winning the matches."
5.5089073,2.8816824,1,"Not much. We were just looking to keep it simple, and yeah, we were just being in the present and enjoying the moment. That's it. We were just keeping it simple."
8.764349,5.241743,2," I said this last week at Evian I wanted to do Top 10, Top 15, which last week I totally failed.  So this week"
8.101241,5.589536,7,"I'm going to have a press conference tomorrow at noon, and I'll address all those things then. I think I want to just confine this to Stras and the Washington Nationals right now, Barry."
4.7103,5.2661786,1,I don't get caught up in that.  I go out ask there and get myself prepared to play a big game and worry about winning.
7.082497,4.659903,2," No.  It is just that you know, the first match I played very good and today, I think I played much better and I feel like match by match I am getting better and better."
8.048411,3.4841702,6,"No, I don't think it really was ever an idea. I threw a bullpen yesterday. Obviously found out when -- a little while ago. But I'm kind of at that point where I'm preparing for Game 6."
6.673459,4.4826255,7,"What about later in your career, the Olympics? Does anything stand out to you as being such a pristine surface to play on?"
6.993674,3.1984198,2,"I think she passed over 2-4 and made zero hitting errors and she did a really nice job. She had a tough matchup there in the last two sets against Samedy, and she got her hands in front of it."
7.8080115,3.3460872,4," Yeah, I mean, given the condition, I think 67 is a great score, let alone tied for the lead.  Any time you're leading a PGA TOUR event, you have shot a great round of golf."
8.461107,4.3517857,7,"  It definitely reminded me of it, just the excitement, the ""I can't believe this.""   I definitely saw myself, 27 LeBron, 27 AD.  I definitely saw myself in that."
5.452016,5.8162966,1,"MIKE LEACH: Yeah, it's kind of a next-man-up deal.  It's a lot like practice or spring or camp  you just play the next guy."
9.233465,4.321395,4," At times, no.  At times, yes.  Depends on the player, depends on the day.  As far as today, I think that I just definitely went for too much at times."
6.920417,7.1797247,2,"  Well, she's going to get better open looks in this series than she did in the last series, so that's a positive, number one."
7.5358553,3.204066,4,"No, definitely not.  I'm just thankful I shot a really good round today and I got myself back into it."
7.4275985,2.4217808,6,I personally don't think so. I don't think it's one point or two points that determine anything. It's going to sting just as much.
5.949172,7.206142,7,You think about a lot of things before signing. You think about a lot. But I never thought that I'd be here in the big leagues at the biggest stage and performing at the biggest stage.
8.06227,7.1220813,1,"She won't be able to answer that. Yeah, she still was going to sit out. She's a precautionary risk, so like Chloe said, she would probably be expected to play in the semifinal."
6.5518336,3.4593396,1,"  Yes, because before couple weeks I don't have a confidence, you know, like distance.  If I have like a between club, like how do I this, so much thinking before shot."
7.070523,6.6541495,6,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably not going to be a lot of odd-man rushes.  We know that.  It's been a tight series.  Not a lot of room out there."
6.0782366,6.257443,4,"We tried to back up bowlers with the field, with setting the field, but the bowlers didn't really bowl to their field. So, yeah, in that respect, it just didn't go our way."
7.3201275,5.806312,2,I don't think there was one thing that I helped him with.  I think Andre is probably giving more credit to me than I deserve.
5.2448626,5.6106277,2," I don't know.  Maybe.  I hope so, but I have to try to play the next year in the big tournaments claycourt; I have to play good and then to get points and go up in the ranking."
6.654444,5.6225286,7,Had to make a choice between that and Mexico and come home again is going to be the order of the day.  More breakfast.
6.0711713,2.2915332,4," On 17, I didn't hit a good drive.  I hit a 5 iron in.  I had 235 to the pin.  I carried it 223 or so with a 5 iron.  But my driver was very hesitant."
6.70395,6.081339,7,"As of right now, yes. I think he talked to some of you guys already. He gave you thumbs up, didn't he?"
6.969281,4.172985,7,"You know what, he's coming to the game. He's a fan. Hopefully he cheers for the Washington Nationals, and I hope he enjoys the game."
7.241084,4.4027824,4,"It's an incredible feeling. I really don't have many words right now. But after winning games one and two, we had a lot of confidence going into Game 3. Didn't go our way."
4.754042,5.0731816,7," No.  I knew I was going to play two days in a row.  I was supposed to start on Monday, so was prepared for that."
8.832418,3.9851882,7," I am extremely delighted.  I think it's funny because when I won back in '98, I never even made a trip into the media room until after I won.  (Laughing).  So this is my first time."
7.0884056,5.1298723,2," As I said, I really believe I am a better player now and I think I deserve it more, these days and I think I am ready for it much better than I did in that year."
5.750249,2.142305,7,I did not get a free dinner actually. There might have been a bill. I might have hit a window or something so --
6.1797,4.1779027,7,"  Oh, I can see far away.  I just can't see close up anymore.  Can't read the scorecard, but I can see an eagle over there."
5.569199,3.0933485,4,I would say it was very close to maximum.  But not 100%.  I would say it was very close to maximum.  Maybe you can write for which paper you work for.
9.096949,6.5332456,4,"Yeah, everybody is on edge when you go into OT.  One bad bounce, it could be turning out badly for your Team or good for your Team.  Fortunately for us, he put one in."
6.3248024,4.8284874,5,"  Yeah, we'll talk about the starting lineup, we'll submit it 30 minutes prior, not before then. And in terms of the other rotations, obviously you guys will have to see that play out throughout the game."
9.205059,6.218528,7,"  Again, the media is going to look for something, blow something out of proportion.  That's something that's been blown out of proportion."
4.8461185,5.816877,7,"  Not yet.  I saw her son this morning at the daycare.  You know, it is hard to kind of catch up because you're on different schedules and the babies have different schedules."
8.9014435,4.732977,6,"Well, there's been times where that does happen, for sure.  We respond pretty well to adversity.  When it's on the line, we tend to get good results.  That's what we're hoping for tomorrow obviously."
8.873689,3.72016,2," Thank you, Geoff, for joining us.  Great round today.  I know you were probably a little disappointed with that last hole, but still a good day and you're in excellent position for Sunday."
7.0826416,4.5000696,4,"Well, I wasn't aware of that, that a lot of their runs were being scored during that portion of the game. I know in Game 2 obviously it kind of got away from us in those innings."
7.6068463,5.3966184,2,"There was a time maybe when I was -- when I was more beatable, two years back, three years back, but I think I have gotten-- now the players don't really feel that way too much, hopefully."
5.4507127,6.813118,7,"My dream was pitching in the big leagues was my dream. I always imagined playing the World Series and winning the game for us. Something very big for me, big year for me. And I think I'm proud of myself."
8.689474,3.1742806,7," Well, I was on the Nationwide Tour for five years after college, and I've been close a few times.  But I wasn't able to make it out here."
8.135774,4.5311646,7,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really thought about it too much. But I'm sure I'll probably push it back a little bit."
8.707042,3.110418,6,"Yeah, I've never been to the SCG. I've seen it all on TV in the Ashes when I was younger, so it's quite nice to be able to go there and play a game there. Like I'm really excited."
7.785419,6.0255065,4," I didn't make so much final, I mean, it is my second -- third, so -- but one day you have to start to win, so maybe tomorrow."
6.4525642,5.673402,5,"I think other than just the whole keeping the Team motivated, keeping the morale up. I don't know, a lot of guys feed off that. It keeps everyone motivated knowing we're the best. Gives everyone confidence, right?"
8.533038,4.4784374,6,"Yeah, it's exciting. I think after the first couple of games obviously our goal coming here was to be able to get back to Minute Maid. We've accomplished that. And obviously we want to win tonight."
5.6395226,2.8729637,1," No, but I think I was a little bit slower getting into the balls; especially at the net, because I made some mistakes which I shouldn't have.  But that is what happened."
9.067925,6.6407022,1,"  I don't know if you can compare them to any one Team.  I think every Team, every defense has it's own style, it's own characteristics."
8.793095,3.1154833,7,"Yeah, I'll have some family and friends. It's nice to be back in a city that's somewhat familiar. It's an awesome place and I've loved playing here the last couple of years. Yeah, I'm just really excited about it."
5.185638,2.5583804,4," It was just kind of sitting down, nestled down but I could see the ball.  I've been in worse, believe me."
6.5085,4.5704994,1,  It's a huge deal.  It's the switch of a game.  Could be the change of an outcome.  It's key.  We knew that going in we're going to have to close out quarters.  It's tough.  It's not the easiest thing.
7.513554,2.9849572,7,"  It's been a good time.  I got a chance to enjoy the city a little bit for a couple of days, look around.  And again, it's been business at hand."
9.00101,3.392008,7,It's a Taylor Made Rossa putter.  I putted with a Rossa earlier in the year.  I'm going back and forth with it and I grabbed it one out of the barrel and it's totally different than anything I've putted it.
6.002015,7.2110653,5,I think so too. We kept learning as we went. That was the biggest thing. We were just taking it one day at a time and doing whatever we could to just help and benefit the Team.
8.143418,4.861215,5,"  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I show up to win every race, like any of these guys.  If you don't have that mindset, I don't know what you're doing here.  I'll always preach that."
7.7405066,5.446275,2,"I don't know if we can say we don't know a ton about them, just because of how good they are this year and how good they were last year."
6.761412,4.3685956,4,"The BYU match from my freshman year, yeah, I saw a little parallels to that game, just that back and forth, like they were playing amazing defense. It was good to be in that environment in a tough situation."
8.057411,3.550281,4,"  Yeah, I think it rained a lot last night and the course was playing quite long and quite soft.  The fairways are quite wet so we played preferred lies, but it was tough to get on the par-5s."
8.569554,5.477278,7, I didn't eat at Flushing Meadow all two weeks.  What I was doing was getting good New York delis sandwiches and eating turkey sandwiches for two straight weeks and didn't eat here at all.
8.090084,5.690833,7,"Good afternoon. My name is Jon Shevstakovsky, and I am vice president of communications and education at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown. Welcome to the Hall of Fame's MLB press conference."
7.1870623,6.879187,5,"Yeah, I use that as a lot of motivation personally. I love it. Honestly, like, if people want to motivate me, just talk crap about me on the Internet. It works pretty well (smiling)."
5.5934005,2.227763,4,"We actually hit some balls hard, we really did. We just can't get nothing going these last three days. But we hit some balls hard."
6.5935955,4.0648074,4,"Execute.  Last night was a lot better, simplified getting pucks to the net, got some traffic.  We had some pretty good looks.  I probably should have scored on the one.  Hit the post or whatever, so..."
5.981381,3.375074,4,"  Pretty tough start.  You know, like actually 1st hole I make bogey I feel like it's can happen because like long par-4."
7.359453,6.013222,2," Bart, you've had a consistent year as far as making cuts, and you're 168th on the money list but maybe you haven't finished as well as --"
7.833987,5.7978253,4," I thought I had a chance to go in the fifth set, especially with the breakpoint in the next game."
9.340642,5.2202187,5,"Yeah, obviously it feels great when you do something for your Team, and yeah, I'm really looking forward for the semis now."
5.216284,5.2842774,4,"  It was a little bit luck that -- Todd normally plays with Arantxa and Arantxa decided not to play the mixed over here, so Todd was deciding to play or not to play the mixed and then--"
6.5690913,6.926715,4,"  I was talking to Sue about it before we finished.  I talked to Cathy [Engelbert] about it before my Podcast.  To be able to be the 2020 WNBA champs, it's a huge gold star next to that."
8.791764,2.9349144,7," I've got a bunch of family in town, so I'll probably just be at home and entertain all of the family that I've got in town."
6.526894,5.9078894,5,"Yeah, I think those guys both came into our program a little unsure of what their role would be.  They're both very humble and quiet kids.  Credit that's guys for bringing your younger defensemen along."
7.837427,4.124857,3,"  He's a competitor.  What he's trying to do -- you tip your hat to a guy like that.  Obviously, it's a terrible time going down with an injury.  An injury of that caliber obviously hinders you a little bit."
6.9405684,7.153746,4,"This was the first time we've played in these conditions, and it's very different than ours. Usually we have the series, more series in Asia."
6.910521,2.5273056,2,"I think so.  I shot 66 and I was winning so I knew I was going to qualify, so I came straight over and practiced a little bit and got some free clubs and the whole bit."
7.4752817,4.215062,7," Because they was playing volleyball in the big club in France and the first activity was the tennis, so I start with my girlfriend because they was playing tennis so I was playing tennis with them."
6.406148,3.8020895,7,"Well, I think I would characterize it as a tale of two cities. I think as between the negotiating committees, the dialogue has gotten a little more positive in the most recent set of meetings."
6.8765764,5.388907,2, I think it is difficult to say because I think he is second tournament.  I don't know how many tournaments he played.
6.030164,4.7041283,5,"I feel a lot better after today, getting out of here with a good day, leading laps here. I feel good about that leading into next week."
4.6070504,4.599217,6,"So, yeah, the pitch will probably play the same for both Teams. So it's just a matter of consistency on our part to do well in all aspects of the game."
4.9329953,6.187434,5,"I don't know. Everyone is a little bit different, honestly. You just try and get to know one another and try and be authentic and explain who we are, try and find out about the player."
8.903371,6.1109138,5,"This Team had such a great year, and to end like that -- they are a great Team. I just wish we could have responded like we have been."
6.294939,4.855544,1,"Yeah, just in general terms if you look at a lineup and you have -- the fewer guys you have to game plan for, you know, the easier it is to navigate a game on the other side."
8.753739,3.0155554,5,"I don't think I'll be able to describe what it's going to be like.  I know from what I've seen, I've been very, very impressed.  We're excited to get back home and show what this town's about."
7.646807,6.0312705,2,Certainly know who they are. This is certainly about our young core. Those two guys are part of it. They're probably the next wave of players coming.
6.4904995,5.38561,4," Well, as far as I am concerned importance of the tournament and the kind of the player I beat today, yes."
5.1146183,4.7405524,1,"Yeah, it was a lot different this year.  We had the experience.  We knew what the crowd was going to be like.  We actually practiced with crowd noise on our last practice at home."
4.8383656,4.4199643,2,"I'm glad he told you that. I talked to him today, he says he feels real good. He's going to go. And he's going to pitch. And we'll see how far he can take us."
6.6987977,6.1882763,2,"We're counting on Cano. He's another guy that had a bad year last year. Knowing him, knowing his preparation, I have no doubt he'll show up at Spring Training ready to go."
8.3660755,3.8697617,4," He was out today and hopefully get a chance to see him in the next couple of days, I wanted to go last night, but -- obviously I had a match."
6.2555923,5.6088743,7,"I think I might have been in 2000.  I think I was the oldest guy.  Nick Price was there, and I think I have him by maybe four or five months in age."
5.097067,5.336548,4,"Like I said, I just don't -- I don't want to make this about one play. It was a big play. I just don't want to make it about one play."
7.492623,2.3087566,4," I didn't about that.  I just tried to play it point by point to see the next point and don't think about beyond five sets, four sets, beat Jim Courier just --"
8.106427,5.331864,4,"  I don't necessarily think it is an advantage.  You know, we have been involved in a Championship Game already this year.  But once you cross the white lines, it is all the same."
6.1202917,6.566915,2,"CHRIS HIGGS:  I think the only debate about any one player's performance is she being, whoever 'she' is  Is she being measured fairly amongst all other players."
7.9206414,3.7726717,7,"Exactly. We play this part kind of back to back to back, so it's nice to be in the same place. A travel day does take its toll a little bit. So I'm happy we're in Sydney."
4.731042,5.3538346,7, It is enough to worry about is what is in front of me.  I don't need to worry about what everybody else is doing.
8.368947,4.588151,2," Oh, definitely.  I mean, definitely. She beat her earlier this year in Delray Beach.  I mean, I know Gaby is going to remember that.  I mean, I definitely think that she has a great chance."
5.792412,5.4118967,1,"We're pretty good, too. We're going to try to adapt to him. And I think our pitchers did a good job of mixing. We didn't stay in one area, we didn't get him out the same way twice, really."
8.152142,6.9313784,7,"It's devastating. It's not something that I wish on anybody in this room. Just like I don't wish any of you to be standing up here having to answer these questions, either."
6.8619366,6.2256217,7,I think he'll be great. He's a fun-loving guy. He's a different dude. I think he'll be great in that culture.
7.564148,7.2438083,7,"No. They haven't reached out because of that. I've had players reach out to me this off-season, but not specifically for -- after the trade about other things."
4.827161,4.352615,4,"I mean, they won some two-strike counts. They battled. I mean, I feel like I've said this a few times since we've been to the postseason, our opponents have not taken a pitch off."
5.95198,2.4061108,4," 3, I hit it in the rough left and then hit it in the front left bunker, just got it on to the green and 2-putted."
